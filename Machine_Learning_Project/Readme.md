# 3.3 Data Collection Strategy

- Determine Data Requirements: Determine what data is needed for the analysis, including historical prices, economic indicators, and news data.

- API Usage: Use APIs to automatically collect data from Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and other platforms.

- Web Scraping: Use web scraping if necessary to obtain data from sites that do not offer APIs.

- Data Storage: Store the collected data in CSV format or in a database for further analysis.

# 4. Data Analysis

## 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Univariate Analysis:

Build histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of prices and other variables.
Identify outliers and anomalies in the data.

- Multivariate Analysis:

Build a correlation matrix to identify relationships between different variables.
Use visualizations (e.g., heat maps) to represent correlations.

- Time Series Analysis:

Plot time series graphs for visualize trends and seasonality in the data.
Use moving average techniques to smooth the data and identify trends.

- News Analysis:

Investigate the impact of news on price movements using text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis Strategy

- Hypothesis Testing: Develop hypotheses about the factors that influence futures prices and test them using statistical methods.

- Data Visualization: Use visualization libraries (e.g. Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create graphs that help understand the data.

- Pattern Identification: Use clustering techniques (e.g. K-Means) to identify patterns in the data.

# 5. Machine Learning Model Selection

## 5.1 Suitable Models

- Decision Tree: Good for interpretation and visualization, helps understand which factors are most important for price prediction.

- Gradient Boosting (e.g. XGBoost): Provides high accuracy and handles non-linear relationships well.

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Effective for time series analysis, especially when the sequential nature of the data is important.

## 5.2 Model Selection Rationale

A gradient boosting model (e.g. XGBoost) is the most suitable for this task due to its ability to handle large amounts of data and detect complex relationships. This model also provides high accuracy and allows easy hyperparameter tuning to improve the results.

# 6. Model Training and Evaluation

## 6.1 Data Preparation

- Data Preprocessing:

  - Gap Handling: Filling gaps with mean or median values.
  - Data Normalization: Bringing data to a common scale (e.g. Min-Max or Z-score).
  - Feature Creation: E.g. Moving Averages, Volatility Indicators, etc.

- Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g. 80% for training and 20% for testing).

## 6.2 Model Training

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.

Train the Model: Train the model on the training set using the chosen algorithm (e.g. XGBoost).

## 6.3 Model Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the quality of the model.

Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to more reliably evaluate the performance of the model.

# 7. Model Deployment

## 7.1 Deployment Strategy

Build the Interface: Develop a web application (e.g. using Flask or Django) that will interact with the model and allow users to make predictions.

Integration with Trading Systems: Integrate the model with existing trading systems to automate decision making.

User Training: Provide training to traders and investors on how to use the model and interpret its forecasts.

## 7.2 Benefits of Deployment
